    - Ah god dammit, what was that! I can't believe what he just did. I'm gonna need
      to grab a drink from the Vending Machine at the Top Right of this room, to
      wash this stuff off my tongue.
    - But he seemed to have dropped some Life Juice. I think I can use this Life
      Juice to get stronger by interacting with the menu on the bottom left of the
      screen.
    - I should probably head down half way through the building to go tell Ben about
      this.
