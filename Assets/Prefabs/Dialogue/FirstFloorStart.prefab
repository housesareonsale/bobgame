    - I seemed to have gone only a level down instead of to Bens floor, that is weird.
      I should look for the next elevator to head down again, and keep my guard up,
      I have a feeling Denver won't be the last guy I have to off.
    - 'My God, this office always seemed like a maze, and the dim lights are making
      it even worse. '
    - I should probably keep my eyes peeled for more vending machines, I don't know
      what is in them, but they seem to give my stapler extra super powers, which
      I think I'm going to need if I want to get out of this office.
